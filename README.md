# Apriori Algorithm

# Please	 implement	 a	 program	 in Java	 to	 list	 all	 frequent	 itemsets with increasing	size given	a	minimum	support	threshold	s and	a	list	of	baskets.	The	input	 and	output	 format	is	comma	separate	values	 (CSV),	and	each	item	can	be	number	or	string.

# Implemented the Apriori algorithm to effectively mine for frequent itemsets which can help understand the pattern of the items being bought together with efficient memory management.
